# KotlinBudgetBuddy
Young Adults learning to manage their own assets need an intuitive tool to help catalog and organize their transactions. Budget Buddy is a stepping stone to help individuals new to budgeting by bringing awareness to the total amount they spend in each category and if they are saving or losing money according to their monthly income. Unlike other budget applications, Budget Buddy desires to be minimalistic and intuitive in its design. The tracking of expenses and income should be made easy and reduce repetitive action. The goal of the application is for users to be able to make use of the features without instruction or explanation. Budget Buddy recognizes that individuals new to tracking the transactions may not know their typical budgets by category and instead wants users to understand how each transaction will impact their total saved money, and total spent.
